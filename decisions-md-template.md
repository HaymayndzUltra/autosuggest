# Architectural Decisions Log

## Decision 1: Database Choice
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to choose database for user authentication and data storage
**Decision**: PostgreSQL
**Rationale**: 
- ACID compliance required for financial data
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Better performance than MongoDB for relational data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MongoDB: Rejected due to eventual consistency issues
- MySQL: Rejected due to limited JSON support
- SQLite: Rejected due to concurrency limitations

**Consequences**:
- Need PostgreSQL expertise
- More complex deployment than NoSQL
- Better data integrity and consistency

## Decision 2: Authentication Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need stateless authentication for API
**Decision**: JWT with refresh tokens
**Rationale**:
- Stateless design fits microservices architecture
- Refresh tokens provide security for long-lived sessions
- Industry standard with good library support
- Scales well horizontally

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based auth: Rejected due to stateful nature
- OAuth2: Rejected due to complexity for internal API
- API keys: Rejected due to security concerns

**Consequences**:
- Need to handle token expiration
- Refresh token rotation required
- Stateless but tokens can't be revoked easily

## Decision 3: Password Hashing
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need secure password storage
**Decision**: bcrypt with 10 rounds
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for password hashing
- Adaptive hashing (can increase rounds over time)
- Built-in salt generation
- Good balance of security and performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Argon2: Rejected due to limited library support
- scrypt: Rejected due to complexity
- Plain text: Rejected for obvious security reasons

**Consequences**:
- CPU intensive but secure
- Need to handle async hashing
- Can't retrieve original passwords

## Decision 4: API Style
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to design API architecture
**Decision**: RESTful API
**Rationale**:
- Simple and well-understood
- Good tooling and documentation support
- Easy to test and debug
- Stateless design fits JWT auth

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL: Rejected due to complexity and learning curve
- gRPC: Rejected due to HTTP/JSON requirement
- SOAP: Rejected due to complexity

**Consequences**:
- Multiple endpoints for complex queries
- Potential over-fetching of data
- Standard HTTP status codes

## Decision 5: Rate Limiting Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to prevent abuse of auth endpoints
**Decision**: IP-based rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Effective against brute force attacks
- Good balance of security and usability
- Works well with stateless design

**Alternatives Considered**:
- User-based limiting: Rejected due to complexity
- Token-based limiting: Rejected due to implementation complexity
- No rate limiting: Rejected due to security concerns

**Consequences**:
- Legitimate users might be blocked
- Need to handle rate limit headers
- May need whitelist for trusted IPs

## Decision 6: Error Handling Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need consistent error responses
**Decision**: Centralized error middleware with structured responses
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error format across API
- Easy to debug and monitor
- Can log errors centrally
- Good user experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Individual error handling: Rejected due to inconsistency
- Silent failures: Rejected due to debugging difficulty
- Generic errors: Rejected due to poor UX

**Consequences**:
- Need to maintain error codes
- More complex error handling logic
- Need comprehensive error documentation

## Decision 7: Testing Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need reliable testing approach
**Decision**: Jest + Supertest for unit and integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Jest is industry standard for Node.js
- Supertest provides excellent API testing
- Good mocking capabilities
- Easy CI/CD integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mocha + Chai: Rejected due to Jest's better ecosystem
- Manual testing: Rejected due to unreliability
- No testing: Rejected due to quality concerns

**Consequences**:
- Need to maintain test suite
- Tests can become outdated
- Additional development time

## Decision 8: File Upload Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Pending
**Context**: Need to handle user file uploads
**Decision**: TBD
**Rationale**: TBD

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TBD

**Consequences**:
- TBD

## Decision 9: Caching Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Pending
**Context**: Need to improve performance
**Decision**: TBD
**Rationale**: TBD

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TBD

**Consequences**:
- TBD

## Decision 10: Deployment Strategy
**Date**: 2024-10-12
**Status**: Pending
**Context**: Need production deployment approach
**Decision**: TBD
**Rationale**: TBD

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TBD

**Consequences**:
- TBD

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### When to Document Decisions
- **Architectural choices**: Database, framework, language
- **Security decisions**: Authentication, encryption, validation
- **Performance choices**: Caching, optimization strategies
- **Integration decisions**: External services, APIs
- **Process decisions**: Testing, deployment, monitoring

### Decision Status Values
- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Implemented and active
- **Rejected**: Considered but not chosen
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision

### Template Usage
1. Copy the decision template
2. Fill in all sections
3. Update status as decision evolves
4. Reference in code comments when relevant

### Review Process
- Review decisions monthly
- Update status when decisions change
- Document lessons learned
- Share with team for feedback

### Integration with Code
Reference decisions in code:
```typescript
// Decision 2: JWT with refresh tokens
// See decisions.md for rationale
const token = jwt.sign(payload, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
```

### Decision Dependencies
Track how decisions affect each other:
- Database choice affects caching strategy
- Auth strategy affects API design
- Testing strategy affects deployment approach
