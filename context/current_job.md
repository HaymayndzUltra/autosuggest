Summary
We’re looking for a creative, reliable full-stack developer who can vibe code (i.e., think beyond templates and build with intuition + purpose) to bring a modern Learning Management System (LMS) / Training Platform to life.

The goal: build an elegant, intuitive platform that supports course creation, user progress tracking, quizzes, and content delivery — with a scalable architecture that allows for new features to be added later.

We’re not looking for cookie-cutter code or a WordPress plug-in setup — we want someone who enjoys clean, efficient, and expandable codebases and understands good UX/UI flow for learning experiences.

Key Responsibilities:
Architect and develop the MVP of a learning management / training platform (front and back end), with scalability for other functionality
AI integration
Implement user roles (admin, instructor, learner).
Build core features such as:
User authentication and onboarding
Course creation and management
Progress tracking and analytics
Video / document / quiz integration
Librarys
Dashboard for users and admins
Ensure the platform is modular and ready for future integrations (API, mobile app, etc.).
Collaborate on design direction and user experience.

Tech Stack (Preferred, but flexible):
Vibe coding: familiar with Cursor or similar
Frontend: React, Next.js, or Vue
Backend: Node.js, Express, or Django
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Hosting / DevOps: AWS or similar

Required:
Has built or contributed to SaaS, LMS, or e-learning projects before.
Can vibe code
Experience integrating AI tools

Ideal Candidate:
Communicates clearly and proactively.
Understands scalability and future-proofing in software design.
Enjoys collaborating on projects that mix technology, education, and user experience.

Deliverables
Initial build: MVP version of the LMS (core platform + user management + course flow).
Timeline: ~6–10 weeks for MVP, with potential for ongoing work as we scale.
Long-term potential: Ongoing development, new feature builds, and platform evolution.
